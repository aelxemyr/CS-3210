	Here is some indented text to start out,
spanning multiple lines. 
Here is a line with trailing white space (which should be intact).
Above is a "true blank" line. Below consists of spaces and tabs.
A little more text 
A line, 
"// A comment within a string."
"/* This should be preserved. */"
White space above to be removed.
"This is a string /*" which appears to initialize a comment but should not. */
i.e., the entirety of the above line should be intact.

\* Nor is this a comment *\
