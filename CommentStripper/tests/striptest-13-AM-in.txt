	Here is some indented text to start out,
spanning multiple lines. // A comment at the end of this line.
Here is a line with trailing white space (which should be intact).

Above is a "true blank" line. Below consists of spaces and tabs.

A little more text /* followed by a block comment. */
/* A multi-line block comment here,
   which means that all of this text
   will be removed by the stripper.
*/

A line, /* and another multi-
line comment. */

"// A comment within a string."

"/* This should be preserved. */"





White space above to be removed.

"This is a string /*" which appears to initialize a comment but should not. */
i.e., the entirety of the above line should be intact.

\\ This is not a comment.

\* Nor is this a comment *\
