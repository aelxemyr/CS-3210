# CS-3210
Projects from CS 3210, Principles of Programming Languages, at the Metropolitan State University of Denver during Fall 2016.

Project 1: A preprocessor for a compiler. Takes a text file and removes blank lines and comments (of the // and /* variety).
           My final solution was written in Scala, but an initial version was written in Java, since this was my first program
           in Scala.

Project 2: A series of small programs written in Common Lisp.

Project 3: Images drawn using PostScript.

Included are some other snippets: a loop unroller written in Clojure and the solution to a puzzle in Prolog.
